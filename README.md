# StressReliefAutomatedMonitoring
Tia Portal control code for an ON-OFF temperature, and existent current, monitoring system using a S7-1200 Siemens PLC.

The On-off control logic was implemented in the TIA PORTAL software, thanks to the ladder language which allows for a logical sequence of the process in its 3 stages. In this software, a 2-screen HMI was integrated, one for the process configuration where the parameters required for the process could be entered, and another for the temperature visualization.
